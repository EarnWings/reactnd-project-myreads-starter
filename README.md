# MyReads Project

This is project 6 for Udacity's Front End Web Design Nanodegree. The project provided CSS and HTML markup, but required students to generate the React code that was needed. Our job was to add interactivity to the app by refactoring the static code in the template.

## To use the app

To get started right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Contributing

This is a project created to work toward obtaining a nanodegree from Udacity, and therefore pull requests will be ignored.
